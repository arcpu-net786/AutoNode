# AutoNode

This project is the simplest multi-party communication protocol that encapsulates the client and server of a TCP/IP protocol as a single entity called a "node". Each node is independent and can communicate with each other if they connect. They can also gracefully disconnect, find their peers, broadcast, multicast, anycast, and unicast.
